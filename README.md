## Overview
Chirp refers to the distinctive frequency increase of the gravitational wave as two massive bodies, like black holes or neutron stars, spiral closer before they merge. As these bodies orbit each other, they lose energy by emitting gravitational waves, causing the orbit to shrink and the frequency and amplitude of the waves to increase. This leads to a "chirping" sound when translated to audio.
